# Socket Client Script

##  Overview
This script implements a **TCP client** that connects to a remote server, executes commands, and facilitates file transfers. It enables remote shell access by allowing a listener to send and receive commands.

##  Features
- Establishes a connection with a remote server.
- Supports **remote command execution**.
- Allows **changing directories** on the remote machine.
- Facilitates **file upload and download** using **Base64 encoding**.
- Maintains communication using **JSON-based data transmission**.

##  How It Works
1. **Connection Establishment:**
   - The script initializes a **TCP socket client**.
   - It connects to a predefined IP and port where the listener (server) is running.

2. **Command Execution:**
   - Receives commands from the listener.
   - If the command is:
     - `quit`: The client terminates the connection.
     - `cd <directory>`: Changes the working directory.
     - `download <file>`: Sends the requested file to the listener.
     - `upload <file>`: Receives and saves a file sent by the listener.
     - Other commands: Executes the command using the system shell.

3. **File Transfer Mechanism:**
   - **Upload:**
     - Receives a Base64-encoded file and saves it locally.
   - **Download:**
     - Reads a file, encodes it in Base64, and sends it to the listener.

##  Security & Ethical Considerations
This script allows **remote command execution**, which can pose security risks if misused. Some key concerns include:
- **Unauthorized access** if exposed to the internet without proper security measures.
- **Remote code execution risks** if connected to an untrusted listener.
- **Data interception vulnerabilities** if not secured with encryption.

âš  **Warning:** Ensure that this script is used only for ethical and educational purposes within a controlled environment.

##  Possible Use Cases
- **Penetration Testing:** Assessing security vulnerabilities by simulating remote shell access.
- **Remote System Administration:** Managing remote systems through command execution.
- **File Transfers:** Securely moving files between systems.
